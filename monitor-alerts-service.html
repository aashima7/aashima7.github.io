                            <p style="padding-top: 50px;">Your team can now spin up limitless cloud resources on demand from virtual machines to managed databases. This is a huge benefit for everyone moving to cloud, but as its said with great power comes great responsibility.
                                This does puts stress on reducing cloud cost, keeping services secure, monitor uptime and fix performance bottlenecks. Thus it's very important that each resource you launch is enabled for monitoring. As you enable monitoring logs for each service, analysing them and finding issues again becomes a huge task for your developer team.
                                <h4 class="dark-blue">Key areas to monitor</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The main idea to collect logs for each service should be to gain understanding about following key areas: <br><br>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Utilization:</b> What is the utilization percentage of your resource. Let's say you have launched a virtual machine of 8vcpu with 16GB RAM, and average CPU consumption of the resource is 20%, then its very clear that you should scale down your machine to a lower instance size. <br>
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Saturation:</b> How many times is your resource getting overwhelmed with the amount of work to be done. Continuing with our earlier example: if your machine hits 100% CPU 3 times a day, then you know that there are times when you need to autoscale so as to handle the load.
                                        </li><br>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Errors:</b> Each resource has their own way to generate errors, in case of web, the example erros can be 5xx generated by your server.
                                        </li><br>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Availability:</b> This represents the amount of time your machine was available to do the work, without getting overwhelmed.
                                        </li><br>
                                    </ol>
                                </p>

                                    There are a few other types of metrics that are neither work nor resource metrics,
                                    but that nonetheless may come in handy in diagnosing causes of problems.
                                    Common examples include counts of cache hits or database locks.

                                <h4 class="dark-blue">Alerts</h4>
                                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                                    Automating alerts across as many of your systems as possible allows you to respond quickly to issues and provide better service, and it also saves time by freeing you from continual manual inspection of metrics.
                                    As a best practice alert should always be divided into different serverity levels, last thing you want is alerts which needs no specific action. All alerts should have following components.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Metric:</b> Metric you are tracking any anomaly on this metric should be alerted.
                                        </li><br>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Alert delivery channel:</b> What is the delivery channel for the alert email, notification or call. The most servere alert should use delivery channel as call.
                                        </li><br>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Trigger:</b> What is the trigger point of the metric on which you should be alerted.
                                        </li><br>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Resolution:</b> What are the steps to be taken or analysis to be done in case the alert is triggered.
                                        </li><br>
                                    </ol>
                                    There are certain alerts which have to be raised before the issue goes out of hand, say for example CPU usage, you dont want to set alert when CPU usage is at 100% at that time system would become unresponsive and there is nothing that you will be able to do.
                                </p>
                                <h4 class="dark-blue">Action steps ?</h4>
                                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                                    Most of the time we see that an alert raised is caused due to alert raised by some other service that is why its very important to get to the root cause whenever an alert is raised. For eg: ALB could report high latency in your service, this high latency could be due to the fact that your backend hosts are overburden which could be due to autoscaling not getting triggered at the right time when the throughput for your application increased, or increase in throughput is causing DB load which in turns increase latency of your backend application. Thus it's very important to always get to the root cause of the issue.</p>
                                <h4 class="dark-blue">What next ?</h4>
